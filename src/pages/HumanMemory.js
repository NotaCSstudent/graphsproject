              Each Node in our brain is a piece of our memory, and each weight would represent how strong your memory is,
              for example Video Games would mean the node has high weight and the data would be easy to retreive
              but the quadratic formula would have a low weight and difficult to retreive that information
            </h2>
            <h3>
              We can make those nodes stronger by consistently learning the topic over and over again. Video games are easy to pick up because you're doing the action again and again unconiously. 
              So the brain has an easier time getting implementing these actions .
